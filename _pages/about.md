I am a Political Science PhD Candidate at UC San Diego. My main research subject is fiscal and political recentralization as a strategy of democratic backsliding, with a focus on Europe and North America. I have completed past published work on elections reform and voter behavior in the United States. My secondary interests include European political parties, promissory democracy, and democratic resilience.

Previously, I completed an MSc in Statistics at the University of Warwick, and a BA in Political Science and Mathematics at Reed College. My MSc dissertation project focused on Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for quantifying gerrymandering in the American states.
