I am a political scientist who studies contemporary challenges to democracy in a comparative perspective. My research examines the shifting dynamics facing liberal democracies in the twenty-first century, with a regional focus on Europe. These challenges are complex and multifarious, from malign autocratic elected officials seeking to maximize their power, to changing global economic circumstances, to valid popular concerns over representation and electoral disproportionality and the decline of the welfare state. As a response to this context, my research agenda seeks to better understand the constantly evolving nature of democracy and its opponents.

Previously, I completed an MSc in Statistics at the University of Warwick, and a BA in Political Science and Mathematics at Reed College. My MSc dissertation project focused on Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for quantifying gerrymandering in the American states.
