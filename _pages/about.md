I am a Political Science PhD student at University of California San Diego. My research interests include elections administration, voter behavior, and democratic resilience. My adviser at UCSD is Thad Kousser. While I mainly focus on U.S. politics, I am hoping that my future work branches out to European elections and strengthening European democracy. 

Previously, I completed an MSc in Statistics at the University of Warwick, and a BA in Political Science and Mathematics at Reed College. My dissertation project focused on Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for quantifying gerrymandering in the American states.
